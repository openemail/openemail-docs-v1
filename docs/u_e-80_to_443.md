Since February the 28th 2017 openemail does come with port 80 and 443 enabled.

**Do not use the config below for reverse proxy setups**, please see our reverse proxy guide for this, which includes a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.

Open `openemail.conf` and set `HTTP_BIND=0.0.0.0` - if not already set.

Now we need to redirect all requests other than autoconfig.* to HTTPS. You do not need to change anything in the template below.

Open `data/conf/nginx/site.conf` and add two new server configs at the top of that file:

```
server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name autoconfig.*;
  root /web;
  location / {
    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
    fastcgi_pass phpfpm:9002;
    include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root/autoconfig.php;
    try_files /autoconfig.php =404;
  }
}
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;
  include /etc/nginx/conf.d/server_name.active;
  if ( $request_uri ~* "%0A|%0D" ) { return 403; }
  return 301 https://$host$uri$is_args$args;
}
```

In case you changed the HTTP_BIND parameter, recreate the container:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Otherwise restart Nginx:

```
docker-compose restart nginx-openemail
```
